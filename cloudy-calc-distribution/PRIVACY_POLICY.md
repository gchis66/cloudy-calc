# Privacy Policy for Cloudy Calc

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Cloudy Calc ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles data when you use our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection and Usage

Cloudy Calc is designed with privacy in mind. We want to be clear about our data practices:

- **Local Storage Only**: Cloudy Calc stores all user data (including calculator history, variables, and settings) exclusively on your device using Chrome's local storage API
- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect or process any personal information
- **No Analytics**: We do not use analytics services to track your usage of the extension
- **No External Servers**: The extension does not communicate with any external servers

## Data Stored Locally

The extension stores the following data locally on your device:

- **Calculator History**: Your recent calculations
- **Custom Variables**: Any variables you define (e.g., `@pi = 3.14159`)
- **Settings**: Your preferences such as theme (light/dark) and font size

This information is stored solely to provide functionality and is never transmitted off your device.

## Third-Party Access

We do not share any data with third parties. Since all data remains on your device, no third parties have access to your calculator history, variables, or settings.

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Chrome Web Store listing.
